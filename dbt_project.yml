# this is very important: the framework cannot modify the dispatch order of the main project (this one)
# We need to change it because we override a central macro, get_merge_sql (among a couple others)
# To be able to ensure that even dbt original macros use our new version (and for the framework to work)
# we need these lines. They essentially tell dbt that whenever a macro is dispatched from package dbt, first look in our package
# and use any overrides found there.
